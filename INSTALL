How to install
--------------

Get a tarball of latest release and unpack:

gtar -xzvf qedit-xyz.tar.gz or

I. cmake:
---------

cd qedit-xyz/
cmake .

(see below or use cmake . --help for options)

II. Make:
---------

make
make install

to install the code. This will install qedit in the default installation path of your system (e.g. /usr/local/bin, or /usr/bin, depending on the system).
This usually requires root privileges at the installation stage. 

III. Local installation:
------------------------

Alternatively a different installation path can be set at configuration time using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option. For a local installation use:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME .

Binaries will be created in $HOME/bin.

IV. qmake
---------

Alternatively (and notably on non linux platforms), Qt build system might be used to configure the code:

cd qedit-xyz/
qmake .
make
make install
