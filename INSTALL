How to install Top
-----------------------

Get a tarball of latest release and unpack:
gtar -xzvf Top-X.X.tar.gz or
tar -xzvf Top-X.X.tar.gz

I. autogen.sh: 
-------------

cd Top-X.X/
./autogen.sh

(see below or use ./autogen.sh --help for options)

II. Make:
---------

make install

The default installation prefix is /usr

Make will create the Top application in /usr/bin/Top
and copy the following configuration files in /usr/share/Top:

icon.xpm, the application icon.
pixmaps, the application toolbar pixmaps


III. Local installation:
------------------------

For a local installation use:
./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME

Binaries and resource files will be created in $HOME/bin and
$HOME/share/Top, respectively.

IV. Troubles at configuration:
------------------------------

autogen.sh may possibly complained of not finding the Qt libraries libraries and/or
headers. The default path is assumed to be:

/usr/lib/qt3/lib for libraries
/usr/lib/qt3/include for headers
/usr/lib/qt3/bin for binaries (namely moc, the Qt meta object file generator)

You can tell autogen.sh where to find non default path:

./autogen.sh --with-Qt=[path]

in which case [path]/lib, [path]/include and [path]/bin will be use in place of
the defaults.

You can also explicitely define all path:
using:
./autogen.sh \
  --with-Qt-lib=[lib_path] \
  --with-Qt-include=[include_path] \
  --with-Qt-bin=[bin_path]

Make sure you have all libraries, header for Qt installed on your platform.
